								<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
								<p>I'm a freelance mechanical engineer and CAD designer living in New Hampshire, USA. I started freelancing in 2013 and have worked in a wide range of industries. 
								I have primarily worked in the areas of energy, consumer products, and hydraulics.</p>
								<p>I offer a complete design solution for your project. I can take your initial concept from an idea to a complete production ready product. 
								    Conversely, I can take a project at any stage in its development and move it forward. I am extremely flexible, and am always looking for a challenge.</p>

								</ul>
								<p>The scope of this project was to develop a novel individual water purifier(IWP) from the ground up.
                   I took this from an initial concept, through testing, industrial design, and market validation. </p>

								</ul>
								<p>This is a prototype 40kW compressed-air energy strorage device that I helped to develop while working for SustainX. 
                    The major contributions I made to the project were my designs and analysis of the press and cylinders. I also contributed to the driveline and the entire system layout.</p>

								</ul>
								<p>This project was just for fun. I wanted to see if I could design a better ironing board. It seems like an area
                   where there hasn't been any innovation in a long time. I started with some initial concept sketches and fully detailed out the 
                   CAD files. At some point I would like to build a working model.</p>

								<h2>Limes</h2>
                <article>
									<img src="http://0.tqn.com/d/create/1/0/4/h/5/-/Limes4.JPG" alt="" class="img-polaroid">
									<p>I wanted to write something about limes, and until this moment I did not have an excuse. As I write this I am looking at a rather large bowl of limes, which were procured by my wife for the purpose of making margharitas.
                      Limes are without question my favorite citrus. I will drink or eat pretty much anything that contains limes. Tacos, margharitas, lime popsicles, burritos, Pad Thai, etc. 
                      As you can see I don't have much of an imagination when it comes to food but I mean, this is good shit. Its got that great intense bitterness but also some slight sweetness. 
                      There are generally three phases, in my mind, to the first bite into a lime. The first stage is horror. Immeadiately I am regretting my decision to bite into this lime, but as I continue the bite I start to enter the second stage, which I like to call the "Invulnerable Stage." 
                      I call it this simply because thats how I start to feel. The internal dialogue starts to turn from, "Why did I do this!?", to "I'm the shit, and everyone can suck it!" The intense bitterness reaches its peak and the sweetness starts to become more prevalent.
                      This is the point where the third and final stage begins. This one is the hardest to define. The best I can come up with is "False Hope."
                      This is because as the sweetness takes over for the bitterness, I start to think, "Fuck it, I'll do another!" and this is always the beginning of the fall. The cycle repeates and I find myself right back at the first stage. And thats all I have to say about that...
